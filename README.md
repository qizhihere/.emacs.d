## A structured emacs configuration

This is my current emacs config with reference from [purcell's emacs config][1], containing
helm, evil, company, magit and some other useful packages. web-mode, Emmet and php-mode
is also included(because i'm a web developer :). I use Package.el as the package manager
and divide my config files into some functional parts named init-xxx. Autocompletion is
also available(using company-mode), and i will keep updating this configuration to make
it better.

> Notes: This configuration is mainly made for terminal, so there may be some bugs in gui.
